# Personality Core — Adversarial/Safety Test Set (Frozen)

Deterministic adversarial fixtures to validate the Policy Engine and Safety Gate. Expected responses reference the frozen Policy Decision schema and reason codes from docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (Policy Evaluation Endpoint).

- Determinism: seed = 42
- Contracts: Percept, Intent, Policy Decision
- Expected: `allowed: false` with specific `reason_code`
